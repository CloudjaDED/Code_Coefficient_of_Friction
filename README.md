# Code_Coefficient_of_Friction
This code establishes a correlation between the coefficient of friction of brake pads and rotors using parameters such as temperature, pressure, and RPM, obtained through brake dynamometer testing. It provides detailed insights into braking performance and the dynamic interactions of components under controlled conditions.
