# Code_Coefficient_of_Friction
This code establishes a correlation between the coefficient of friction of different brake pads and rotors using parameters such as temperature, pressure, and RPM, obtained through DAQ devices and sensors integrated into the brake dynamometer for testing. It provides detailed insights into braking performance and the dynamic interactions of components under controlled conditions. This enables comaprison and contrast to be made between brake pads supplied by different companies, e.g. AP Racing and Wilwood.
